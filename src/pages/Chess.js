            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The 1972 World Chess Championship was played between World Chess Champion Boris Vasiljevic Spassky of the Soviet Union and Challenger Robert James Fischer of the United States. It was held in Reykjavik, Iceland during the height of the Cold War. Previously, Spassky had won the Candidates tournament of 1966 and 1969 and faced World Champion Tigran Petrosian losing to him in 1966 by a margin of 12&frac12; to 11&frac12; and beating him in 1969 by a margin of 12&frac12; to 10&frac12;. Spassky was known as a player that had a universal style, but could press the initiative when needed. Previous to the 1972 World Chess Championship, most of the World Chess Champions had originated from the Soviet Union. These included players such as Mikhail Tal, Mikhail Botvinik, and Tigran Petrosian. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Bobby Fischer's route to the 1972 World Chess Championship started with a demolition of the field at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal Tournament. This tournament's format was a round-robin style where twenty four of the best grandmasters played each other. The top six players of the Interzonal tournament qualified to the 1971 Candidates match and were Fischer (18&frac12;), Bent Larsen of Denmark (15), Efim Geller of the Soviet Union (15), Robert Hubner of West Germany (15), Mark Taimanov of the Soviet Union (14), and Wolfgang Uhlmann of East Germany (14). Petrosian, who was the loser of the 1969 World Chess Championship, and Victor Korchnoi, as the runner up of the previous Candidates tournament were also included in the 1971 Candidates Tournament. In the Candidates, Fischer destroyed Mark Taimanov 6 - 0 in the quarterfinals and destroyed Bent Larsen in the semifinals 6 - 0 (happened in my hometown of Denver). Fischer then faced Petrosian in the Final in Buenos Aires playing a nine game match which Fischer won by a margin of 6&frac12; to 2&frac12;. An interesting tidbit about the final is that Petrosian ended Bobby Fischer's twenty game win streak following game 2. After winning the Candidates, Fischer was given the right to challenge Spassky for the world title. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The Soviets proposed four cities to host the match which included Reykjavik, Amsterdam, Dortmund, and Paris. Fischer declined all the options due to the low prize fund alloted for the players. Fischer instead wanted to play in Buenos Aires, Sarajevo or Belgrade. Fischer declined also in part to his mistrust of the Soviets and wanted Spassky to come to him across the Atlantic. Dr. Max Euwe, who was president of the chess governing body, FIDE, declared that the match will be held for twelve games in Belgrade and then twelve games in Reykjavik. Fischer and Spassky both hated Euwe's idea because it meant that the world champion could not dictate the terms and Fischer may not be able to get Spassky out of his comfort zone. Euwe gave an ultimatum to Fischer to either play the proposed match in both Belgrade and Reykjavik or that the Championship match will be played between Spassky and Petrosian in Moscow. Fischer reluctantly agreed but stipulated that he wanted more money. As a result, the organizers in Belgrade backed out and Reykjavik was chosen to host all twenty four games.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            One day before the Match of the Century was supposed to take place, Fischer refused to fly from New York to Reykjavik for monetary reasons and thus the match was postponed by an additional two days. Jim Slater, who was a British investor, offered to double the prize fund of the tournament to $250,000. Former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger also pleaded with Fischer to play Spassky in Reykjavik. Eventually, Fischer flew to Reykjavik but the match was still postponed because Spassky demanded that Fischer apologize to FIDE for hijacking the terms of the match. Fischer apologized publicly to Spassky and the match started on July 11th, 1972.

            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            On the evening of July 11th, 1972, Boris Spassky arrived at the playing hall with Bobby Fischer's whereabouts unknown. The arbiter of the match, German Grandmaster Lothar Schmid started the clocks and Spassky with the white pieces played d4. After nine minutes disappear on Fischer's clock, Fischer arrive on stage and plays Nf6. Following c4 and e6, Spassky avoids the Nimzo-Indian defense initially by playing Nf3 and asking Fischer whether to go for a Queen's Indian setup. Fischer ignores this move and plays d5 transposing into the Queen's gambit declined. Spassky then plays Nc3 and then Bb4 transposing into the Nimzo-Indian Defense. Spassky plays e3 as a way to avoid going into an aggressive line similar to a game played between Petrosian and Spassky in the previous Championship match. Fischer castles on move five to get his king to safety and Spassky plays Bd3. Fischer strikes in the center with c5 following up with Nc6. Spassky counters with castles (O-O) and then a3 to challenge Fischer's dark squared Bishop.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            At this point, Fischer can choose either to capture on d4 with his c5 pawn or capture the knight on c3 with the dark squared bishop on b4. However, Fischer backs off and plays Ba5 which Spassky did not expect. After a long think, Spassky plays Ne2 which is a move from a previous game between Spassky and GM Nikolai Krogius. Fischer immediately replies with dxc4 followed by Spassky's bishop capturing on c4 (Bxc4). Fischer moves his darked squared Bishop back to b6 to defend the c5 pawn (Bb6). Spassky captures the pawn on c5 (dxc5) with his D pawn and in the game between Krogius and Spassky, Bxc5 was played but instead Fischer, noticing that Spassky's queen is exposed, plays Qxd1 for a queen trade. Spassky recaptures with Rxd1 and then Fischer with Bxc5. By move twelve, both queens are off the board as well as the e and d pawns for both sides. Spassky reapplies pressure with b4 which forces Fischer's dark squared bishop back to e7 (Be7). Spassky fianchettoes to b2 with his light squared bishop which applies pressure on Fischer's Kingside (Bb2). Fischer plays a nice move with his light squared bishop to d7 (Bd7) which allows Fischer to gain a tempo on Spassky's rook when his knight on c6 moves eventually.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Spassky moves Rac1 which is met with Rfd8. Ned4 is played by Spassky and Fischer exchanges knights with Nxd4 and Nxd4 by Spassky. Fischer now gains a tempo on the rook with Ba4. Spassky stops this with Bb3. Fischer at this point had an option to capture the knight on d4 but this would lead into an endgame where Spassky would end up with the bishop pair compared to Fischer with a bishop and a knight. Instead Fischer captures Spassky's light squared bishop with Bxb3 to which Spassky replies with Nxb3. With an opening on the D file created by Spassky's Nxb3, Fischer plays Rxd1+ (captures with check) followed by Rxd1 by Spassky (exchanging rooks). Fischer then grabs ahold of the C file with Rc8. At this point in the game, the material is equal on the board, but Fischer's remaining rook is in fact more impressive than Spassky's remaining rook because of Fischer's dark squared bishop controlling both d6 and d8 while his knight controlls d7. Fischer can create a rook lift to c7 at any time. Spassky improves the position of his King with Kf1 and Fischer replies with Kf8. Spassky moves Ke2 and Fischer reactivates his knight with Ne4. Spassky challenges Fischer's rook wih Rc1 which leads to a trade of rooks. Fischer plays Rxc1 followed by Spassky's Bxc1.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Fischer now pushes f6 presumably to grab more space on the Kingside and Spassky attacks Fischer's Queenside with Na5. Nd6 is played by Fischer to protect the b7 pawn. Spassky improves the King's position once again with Kd3 and Fischer forces the knight on a5 to move away with Bd8. Nc4 is played by Spassky to exchange knights and Fischer protects with Bc7. The knights are exchanged with Nxd6, Bxd6 and now Spassky advances to b6 moving his pawns on the Queenside to light squares which can't be touched by Fischer's dark squared bishop. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            At this point in the game, the material remains completely even and it seems that the game will proceed into a drawn endgame, but Fischer plays one of the biggest blunders in his entire chess career and possibly in the history of the World Chess Championship. Fischer plays Bxh2 which blunders and traps the dark squared bishop. At this moment, everybody in the playing hall audience gasped when this move was played. Spassky correctly traps the bishop with g3. Fischer, seemingly oblivious to his blunder continues with h5 and Spassky completely locks down Fischers bishop by moving Ke2. Fischer pushes h4 followed by Spassky's Kf3. Fischer finally realized that his bishop was trapped and that he might have miscalculated. Fischer moves Ke7 to improve his king and Spassky closes on Fischer's trapped bishop with Kg2. Fischer captures on g3 with hxg3 followed with Spassky's fxg3. Fischer recaptures with Bxg3 and then Kxg3 followed by Fischer's Kd6 making Fischer's king active on the Queenside. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Spassky locks down his Queenside pawns with a4 and Fischer moves Kd5. At this point, the question of the match really is if Fischer's two extra pawns on the Kingside are compensation for Spassky's extra piece. Spassky moves Ba3 which controlls all dark sqaures on the Queenside. Fischer moves Ke4 to attack white's e3 pawn and Spassky defends with Bc5. Fischer pushes a6 to break open Spassky's connected pawns on the Queenside. Spassky closes the position with b6 and Fischer pushes f5. Spassky moves Kh4 to get his king closer to Fischer's pawns and Fischer advances f4 challenging white's e3 pawn. At this point, the game was adjourned since the fourty move time control had been reached. Spassky sealed exf4 and Fischer the next day played Kxf4 followed by Spassky's Kh5. Kh5 is a winning idea by white because Spassky's king will now start marching towards Fischer's Queenside to gobble up all of the pawns. Spassky's bishop will protect the b6 pawn which is the winning pawn. Fischer has to prevent Spassky's king walk by playing Kf5 which is met with Be3 and then Ke4 attacking the bishop. Spassky gets his bishop out of the way with Bf2 and then Kf5 by Fischer. Spassky now prevents Fischer's king from having any effect on the rest of the game with Bh4 which also puts black's king in zugzwang. Fischer has to move a pawn and he moves e5 followed by Be5. Black plays e4 and Spassky replies with Be3 preventing any further pushing by Fischer's passed C pawn. Fischer now must move the king to f6 (Kf6) followed by white's Kg4. Spassky has freed his King from the H file.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Fischer moves Ke5 and Spassky counters with Kg5. Out of moves, Fischer tries Kd5 to reposition to the Queenside followed by Spassky moving Kf5. Fischer pushes a5 to reopen the Queenside position. Bf2 is played by Spassky and Fischer develops his G pawn to g5 to give it up. Spassky gladly accepts with Kxg5 and Fischer goes for the Queenside pawns with Kc4. Spassky repositions back to f5 (Kf5) and Fischer moves Kb4. Kxe4 followed by Kxa4 are played. Spassky moves Kd5 and Fischer moves Kb5. However, after Spassky played Kd6, Bobby Fischer resigned the game on move 56. 
            <br></br>

            <br></br>
            Following the loss of Game 1, Fischer gave an ultimatum to chief arbiter Lothar Schmid requiring that all television cameras broadcasting the match be removed prior to Game 2. If this ultimatum was not met, Fischer would forfeit the match and leave Reykjavik. Media tycoon Chester Fox had bought all the rights for the match and loss of broadcasting would result in huge financial losses for his company, Chester Fox inc. Fischer however stuck to his ultimatum and by the time game 2 was supposed to start, Fischer was absent. Spassky arrived at the playing hall on time and with the black pieces, started Fischer's clock. By the time thirty five minutes elapsed on Fischer's clock, Fox agreed to remove all cameras from the playing hall so Fischer would show and make his first move as white. Fischer agreed, but stipulated to Lothar Schmid that his elapsed thirty five minutes be given back to him. This request unfortunately could not be fulfilled since there was no regulation in the FIDE match guidelines that allowed for time to be given back. After one hour elapsed, Schmid was forced to stop the clock and Fischer forfeited game 2 giving Spassky a 2 - 0 scoreline over Fischer. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Everybody around the world feared that Fischer was out of the match and it was rumored that Fischer would leave back to the United States and forfeit the match entirely. Before Game 3 was scheduled to start, Fischer's team including his lawyer, Paul Marshall, and his second, William Lombardy, called Schmid to ask if the third game could be played in the back room of the playing hall. Schmid took Fischer's demands to Spassky and surprisingly, against the wishes of the Russian Chess Federation, Spassky agreed to Fischer's terms. On the night of July 16th, 1972, Spassky arrives in the back room, the clock is started and Spassky plays d4. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Fifteen minutes later, Fischer arrived at the back room and complained to Schmid again that the cameras were still too noisy and as a result, all cameras were shut off except for one CCTV camera which was silent. Fischer replied to Spassky with Nf6. Spassky goes into the Queen's Gambit with c4 and Fischer declines the gambit with e6. Spassky responds Nf3 and Fischer plays c5 challenging Spassky to a Benoni game. Spassky accepts the Benoni and plays d5 going into the Modern Benoni main line which is one of Fischer's d4 opening specialities. Fischer defeated German GM Wolfgang Uhlmann in the 1970 Interzonal tournament in a similar Modern Benoni setup. Fischer captures with exd5 and Spassky recaptures playing cxd5 followed by Fischer's d6 idea. Spassky defends his new D pawn with Nc3 and Fischer prepares to Fianchetto his dark squared bishop with Bg7 by first preparing g6. At this point in the game, the position is pretty even and commonly white proceeds with moves such as e4 or h3 but instead Spassky prepared Nd2. Fischer replies with Nbd7 continuing development and Spassky pushes e4. Fischer fianchettoes with Bg7 followed by Spassky's development of the light squared bishop with Be2 and both sides castle (O-O). Fischer moves Re8 to add an attaacker to Spassky's E pawn. The game at this point still resembles a common position of the Modern Benoni, but Spassky surprises Fischer with his preparation and on move 11, plays Qc2. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            The move Qc2 is pivotol in the game as it shifts the queen away from the Kingside of the board. With the queen on its starting square (d1), the battery created with the light squared bishop on e2 prevents black from developing his light square bishop fully. Seeing this move, Fischer takes advantage with Nh5. On the surface level, Fischer is offering a knight to Spassky and a consequent ruining of the pawn structure with the recapture by Fischer's pawn on g6. However, this move actually forces Spassky to capture the knight because all other moves from white will allow back to move into a better position. Spassky plays Bxh5 followed by the recapture by Fischer with gxh5. Spassky moves with pressure on Fischer's D pawn with Nc4. Fischer kicks Spassky's knight on c4 away with his own knight (Ne5). Spassky repositions the knight on c4 with Ne3 keeping an eye on the f5 square which Fischer will eventually push to open up the closed Benoni structure. On move fourteen, Fischer plays Qh4 which creates all sorts of threats on the Kingside of the board for Spassky. The best move for white at move fifteen is Bd2 since Fischer's idea of Nf3+ doesn't hold water. The line from here would continue with something like gxf3 followed by Be5 which threatens checkmate on h2 with Qxh2. Spassky can easily defend by moving the rook to the E file and moving the knight to f1 which will blunt black's initiative. Spassky finds Bd2 which continues development with the dark square bishop while also connecting rooks. Fischer responds with Ng4 to improve the position of the knight on the Kingside and his pawn structure. Spassky must prevent checkmate by the queen on h2 and plays Nxg4 with Fischer recapturing with hxg4. Fischer's pawn structure on this move is now fixed. Spassky plays Bf4 with ideas of repostioning the bishop to g3 to keep an eye on one of the central e5 square.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Fischer finds a great idea with Qf6 to remanouver his queen and attack Spassky's dark squared bishop on f4. If the bishop is moved immediately, say down its current diagonal or to g3, Fischer can play h5 followed by h4 which will crush white's Kingside position. Spassky plays a prophylactic move with g3 to prevent h5 and subsequently h4 by Fischer. Fischer continues development with Bd7 which is met with Spassky's a4. Fischer has to prevent further Queenside expansion by Spassky with b6. Spassky moves his castled rook to the E file with Rfe1 and Fischer pushes a6. Spassky calculates that there is no counterplay possible on the Queenside for white and instead moves Re2 preparing to double rooks on the E file while preparing to push e5 with his current e4 pawn. Fischer plays b5 and Spassky immediately moves Rae1. Fischer spots that e5 will be coming to Qg6 effectively will open an attack on Spassky's queen if e5 is pushed. Spassky moves b3 to halt Fischer's expansion and Fischer plays a waiting move with Re7, potentially preparing to double up on the E file as well. Spassky plays Qd3 to support white's capture of the black b5 pawn and Fischer defends with Rb8. White now trades on the Queenside with axb5 followed by black's axb5. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            In this middlegame, Spassky does not have a good move because e5 can't be pushed since the Queen will be lost and Spassky can't play anything else because Fischer will push b4 on the next move. Spassky elects to play b4 himself and Fischer counters with c4 which attacks the white queen on d3 and creates a passed C pawn for black. Spassky must move his queen and plays Qd2 and Fischer continues his doubling on the E file with Rbe8. Spassky plays the waiting move Re3 since there is no good option for white and Fischer capitalizes with h5 attempting to break open the white Kingside. Spassky must wait with R3e2 and Fischer tests Spassky's patience with Kh7. Spassky has to repeat with Re3 and Fischer replies Kg7. Spassky again plays R3e2 threatening a three fold repetition draw and now Fischer grabs a pawn with Bxc3. Spassky recaptures with Qxc3 and then Rxe4. Rooks are exchanged with Spassky playing Rxe4 followed by Fischer's Rxe4 again. Spassky captures with Rxe4 but this allows Fischer an opening with Qxe4 to improve the position of the black Queen. Spassky moves Bh6 threatening checkmate on g7 with the white queen on c3. Fischer prevents checkmate with Qg6 and on move 35, Spassky plays Bc1 which gets the bishop out of harms way. Fischer pins the bishop with Qb1 and Spassky moves Kf1 attempting to unpin and move the white king out of the corner of the board. Fischer moves Bf5 with ideas of Bd3 or Be4 followed by Bf3. Spassky unpins with Ke2 and black plays Qe4+. With Qe4+, Fischer forces Spassky's Queen out of the long a1 to h8 diagonal and Spassky offers a trade of Queens with Qe3. Fischer moves Qc2+ and Spassky blocks with Qd2. Fischer plays Qb3 preparing for a push of black's C pawn.

            Time control was reached with Fischer's Qb3 on move 40 and now Fischer must seal his 41st move. Spassky plays Qd4 on move 41 which blunders the game and Fischer seals Bd3+. The next day, the game was meant to be continued but before Fischer could arrive to play his 41st move (Bd3+), Boris Spassky resigned the game on move 41 since any move will allow the C pawn to be pushed and thus ends the game for Spassky. Game 3 of the 1972 World Chess Championship was actually the first time Fischer defeated Spassky in classical time control. Game 3 is often cited as the turning point in the match as Fischer now has momentum going into Game 4.
