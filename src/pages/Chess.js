            The 1972 World Chess Championship was played between World Chess Champion Boris Vasiljevic Spassky of the Soviet Union and Challenger Robert James Fischer of the United States. It was held in Reykjavik, Iceland during the height of the Cold War. Previously, Spassky had won the Candidates tournament of 1966 and 1969 and faced World Champion Tigran Petrosian losing to him in 1966 by a margin of 12&frac12; to 11&frac12; and beating him in 1969 by a margin of 12&frac12; to 10&frac12;. Spassky was known as a player that had a universal style, but could press the initiative when needed. Previous to the 1972 World Chess Championship, most of the World Chess Champions had originated from the Soviet Union. These included players such as Mikhail Tal, Mikhail Botvinik, and Tigran Petrosian.

            Bobby Fischer's route to the 1972 World Chess Championship started with a demolition of the field at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal Tournament. This tournament's format was a round-robin style where twenty four of the best grandmasters played each other. The top six players of the Interzonal tournament qualified to the 1971 Candidates match and were Fischer (18&frac12;), Bent Larsen of Denmark (15), Efim Geller of the Soviet Union (15), Robert Hubner of West Germany (15), Mark Taimanov of the Soviet Union (14), and Wolfgang Uhlmann of East Germany (14). Petrosian, who was the loser of the 1969 World Chess Championship, and Victor Korchnoi, as the runner up of the previous Candidates tournament were also included in the 1971 Candidates Tournament. In the Candidates, Fischer destroyed Mark Taimanov 6 - 0 in the quarterfinals and destroyed Bent Larsen in the semifinals 6 - 0 (happened in my hometown of Denver). Fischer then faced Petrosian in the Final in Buenos Aires playing a nine game match which Fischer won by a margin of 6&frac12; to 2&frac12;. An interesting tidbit about the final is that Petrosian ended Bobby Fischer's twenty game win streak following game 2. After winning the Candidates, Fischer was given the right to challenge Spassky for the world title.

            <br></br>
            The Soviets proposed four cities to host the match which included Reykjavik, Amsterdam, Dortmund, and Paris. Fischer declined all the options due to the low prize fund alloted for the players. Fischer instead wanted to play in Buenos Aires, Sarajevo or Belgrade. Fischer declined also in part to his mistrust of the Soviets and wanted Spassky to come to him across the Atlantic. Dr. Max Euwe, who was president of the chess governing body, FIDE, declared that the match will be held for twelve games in Belgrade and then twelve games in Reykjavik. Fischer and Spassky both hated Euwe's idea because it meant that the world champion could not dictate the terms and Fischer may not be able to get Spassky out of his comfort zone. Euwe gave an ultimatum to Fischer to either play the proposed match in both Belgrade and Reykjavik or that the Championship match will be played between Spassky and Petrosian in Moscow. Fischer reluctantly agreed but stipulated that he wanted more money. As a result, the organizers in Belgrade backed out and Reykjavik was chosen to host all twenty four games.

            <br></br>
            One day before the Match of the Century was supposed to take place, Fischer refused to fly from New York to Reykjavik for monetary reasons and thus the match was postponed by an additional two days. Jim Slater, who was a British investor, offered to double the prize fund of the tournament to $250,000. Former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger also pleaded with Fischer to play Spassky in Reykjavik. Eventually, Fischer flew to Reykjavik but the match was still postponed because Spassky demanded that Fischer apologize to FIDE for hijacking the terms of the match. Fischer apologized publicly to Spassky and the match started on July 11th, 1972.

            On the evening of July 11th, 1972, Boris Spassky arrived at the playing hall with Bobby Fischer's whereabouts unknown. The arbiter of the match, German Grandmaster Lothar Schmid started the clocks and Spassky with the white pieces played d4. After nine minutes disappear on Fischer's clock, Fischer arrive on stage and plays Nf6. Following c4 and e6, Spassky avoids the Nimzo-Indian defense initially by playing Nf3 and asking Fischer whether to go for a Queen's Indian setup. Fischer ignores this move and plays d5 transposing into the Queen's gambit declined. Spassky then plays Nc3 and then Bb4 transposing into the Nimzo-Indian Defense. Spassky plays e3 as a way to avoid going into an aggressive line similar to a game played between Petrosian and Spassky in the previous Championship match. Fischer castles on move five to get his king to safety and Spassky plays Bd3. Fischer strikes in the center with c5 following up with Nc6. Spassky counters with castles (O-O) and then a3 to challenge Fischer's dark squared Bishop.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            At this point, Fischer can choose either to capture on d4 with his c5 pawn or capture the knight on c3 with the dark squared bishop on b4. However, Fischer backs off and plays Ba5 which Spassky did not expect. After a long think, Spassky plays Ne2 which is a move from a previous game between Spassky and GM Nikolai Krogius. Fischer immediately replies with dxc4 followed by Spassky's bishop capturing on c4 (Bxc4). Fischer moves his darked squared Bishop back to b6 to defend the c5 pawn (Bb6). Spassky captures the pawn on c5 (dxc5) with his D pawn and in the game between Krogius and Spassky, Bxc5 was played but instead Fischer, noticing that Spassky's queen is exposed, plays Qxd1 for a queen trade. Spassky recaptures with Rxd1 and then Fischer with Bxc5. By move twelve, both queens are off the board as well as the e and d pawns for both sides. Spassky reapplies pressure with b4 which forces Fischer's dark squared bishop back to e7 (Be7). Spassky fianchettoes to b2 with his light squared bishop which applies pressure on Fischer's Kingside (Bb2). Fischer plays a nice move with his light squared bishop to d7 (Bd7) which allows Fischer to gain a tempo on Spassky's rook when his knight on c6 moves eventually.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Spassky moves Rac1 which is met with Rfd8. Ned4 is played by Spassky and Fischer exchanges knights with Nxd4 and Nxd4 by Spassky. Fischer now gains a tempo on the rook with Ba4. Spassky stops this with Bb3. Fischer at this point had an option to capture the knight on d4 but this would lead into an endgame where Spassky would end up with the bishop pair compared to Fischer with a bishop and a knight. Instead Fischer captures Spassky's light squared bishop with Bxb3 to which Spassky replies with Nxb3. With an opening on the D file created by Spassky's Nxb3, Fischer plays Rxd1+ (captures with check) followed by Rxd1 by Spassky (exchanging rooks). Fischer then grabs ahold of the C file with Rc8. At this point in the game, the material is equal on the board, but Fischer's remaining rook is in fact more impressive than Spassky's remaining rook because of Fischer's dark squared bishop controlling both d6 and d8 while his knight controlls d7. Fischer can create a rook lift to c7 at any time. Spassky improves the position of his King with Kf1 and Fischer replies with Kf8. Spassky moves Ke2 and Fischer reactivates his knight with Ne4. Spassky challenges Fischer's rook wih Rc1 which leads to a trade of rooks. Fischer plays Rxc1 followed by Spassky's Bxc1.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Fischer now pushes f6 presumably to grab more space on the Kingside and Spassky attacks Fischer's Queenside with Na5. Nd6 is played by Fischer to protect the b7 pawn. Spassky improves the King's position once again with Kd3 and Fischer forces the knight on a5 to move away with Bd8. Nc4 is played by Spassky to exchange knights and Fischer protects with Bc7. The knights are exchanged with Nxd6, Bxd6 and now Spassky advances to b6 moving his pawns on the Queenside to light squares which can't be touched by Fischer's dark squared bishop. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            At this point in the game, the material remains completely even and it seems that the game will proceed into a drawn endgame, but Fischer plays one of the biggest blunders in his entire chess career and possibly in the history of the World Chess Championship. Fischer plays Bxh2 which blunders and traps the dark squared bishop. At this moment, everybody in the playing hall audience gasped when this move was played. Spassky correctly traps the bishop with g3. Fischer, seemingly oblivious to his blunder continues with h5 and Spassky completely locks down Fischers bishop by moving Ke2. Fischer pushes h4 followed by Spassky's Kf3. Fischer finally realized that his bishop was trapped and that he might have miscalculated. Fischer moves Ke7 to improve his king and Spassky closes on Fischer's trapped bishop with Kg2. Fischer captures on g3 with hxg3 followed with Spassky's fxg3. Fischer recaptures with Bxg3 and then Kxg3 followed by Fischer's Kd6 making Fischer's king active on the Queenside. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Spassky locks down his Queenside pawns with a4 and Fischer moves Kd5. At this point, the question of the match really is if Fischer's two extra pawns on the Kingside are compensation for Spassky's extra piece. Spassky moves Ba3 which controlls all dark sqaures on the Queenside. Fischer moves Ke4 to attack white's e3 pawn and Spassky defends with Bc5. Fischer pushes a6 to break open Spassky's connected pawns on the Queenside. Spassky closes the position with b6 and Fischer pushes f5. Spassky moves Kh4 to get his king closer to Fischer's pawns and Fischer advances f4 challenging white's e3 pawn. At this point, the game was adjourned since the fourty move time control had been reached. Spassky sealed exf4 and Fischer the next day played Kxf4 followed by Spassky's Kh5. Kh5 is a winning idea by white because Spassky's king will now start marching towards Fischer's Queenside to gobble up all of the pawns. Spassky's bishop will protect the b6 pawn which is the winning pawn. Fischer has to prevent Spassky's king walk by playing Kf5 which is met with Be3 and then Ke4 attacking the bishop. Spassky gets his bishop out of the way with Bf2 and then Kf5 by Fischer. Spassky now prevents Fischer's king from having any effect on the rest of the game with Bh4 which also puts black's king in zugzwang. Fischer has to move a pawn and he moves e5 followed by Be5. Black plays e4 and Spassky replies with Be3 preventing any further pushing by Fischer's passed C pawn. Fischer now must move the king to f6 (Kf6) followed by white's Kg4. Spassky has freed his King from the H file.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Fischer moves Ke5 and Spassky counters with Kg5. Out of moves, Fischer tries Kd5 to reposition to the Queenside followed by Spassky moving Kf5. Fischer pushes a5 to reopen the Queenside position. Bf2 is played by Spassky and Fischer develops his G pawn to g5 to give it up. Spassky gladly accepts with Kxg5 and Fischer goes for the Queenside pawns with Kc4. Spassky repositions back to f5 (Kf5) and Fischer moves Kb4. Kxe4 followed by Kxa4 are played. Spassky moves Kd5 and Fischer moves Kb5. However, after Spassky played Kd6, Bobby Fischer resigned the game on move 56.
