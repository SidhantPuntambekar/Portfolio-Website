            The 1972 World Chess Championship was played between World Chess Champion Boris Vasiljevic Spassky of the Soviet Union and Challenger Robert James Fischer of the United States. It was held in Reykjavik, Iceland during the height of the Cold War. Previously, Spassky had won the Candidates tournament of 1966 and 1969 and faced World Champion Tigran Petrosian losing to him in 1966 by a margin of 12&frac12; to 11&frac12; and beating him in 1969 by a margin of 12&frac12; to 10&frac12;. Spassky was known as a player that had a universal style, but could press the initiative when needed. Previous to the 1972 World Chess Championship, most of the World Chess Champions had originated from the Soviet Union. These included players such as Mikhail Tal, Mikhail Botvinik, and Tigran Petrosian.

            Bobby Fischer's route to the 1972 World Chess Championship started with a demolition of the field at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal Tournament. This tournament's format was a round-robin style where twenty four of the best grandmasters played each other. The top six players of the Interzonal tournament qualified to the 1971 Candidates match and were Fischer (18&frac12;), Bent Larsen of Denmark (15), Efim Geller of the Soviet Union (15), Robert Hubner of West Germany (15), Mark Taimanov of the Soviet Union (14), and Wolfgang Uhlmann of East Germany (14). Petrosian, who was the loser of the 1969 World Chess Championship, and Victor Korchnoi, as the runner up of the previous Candidates tournament were also included in the 1971 Candidates Tournament. In the Candidates, Fischer destroyed Mark Taimanov 6 - 0 in the quarterfinals and destroyed Bent Larsen in the semifinals 6 - 0 (happened in my hometown of Denver). Fischer then faced Petrosian in the Final in Buenos Aires playing a nine game match which Fischer won by a margin of 6&frac12; to 2&frac12;. An interesting tidbit about the final is that Petrosian ended Bobby Fischer's twenty game win streak following game 2. After winning the Candidates, Fischer was given the right to challenge Spassky for the world title.
